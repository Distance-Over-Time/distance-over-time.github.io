summary: Hi, I'm Jacob and I'm a technical level and quest designer with a background in shooters, adventure games, and kart racers.  I specialize in level layouts and gameplay scripting, and I have a strong eye for aesthetics. I'm interested in working on games that impact player emotions or change how people think, games where the player is going on an adventure (either open world or linear), or multiplayer maps that strengthen social relationships through teamwork or laughter.
