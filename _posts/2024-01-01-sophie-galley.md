summary: My name is Sophie, and I'm a Scottish-born, California-raised game producer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. With the games that I create, I hope to spark excitement and curiosity in players by exploring relationships between interesting characters, crafting engaging storytelling, sprinkling in life lessons about self-care, and adding a pinch of the unexpected within the familiarity. You will find me handling the production and narrative in most of my projects where I will likely be organizing information, continuously learning by asking questions, and supporting my fellow game developers in any way I can!
