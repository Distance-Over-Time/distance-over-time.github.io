*"I suppose it was foolish of me to think you would be just like all the other souls that showed up here."*


*Navigate the ominous realm of the dead in this blind-accessible, narrative-driven game about death and what comes after. Guided by their cheeky gatekeeper, newly-deceased Uri must track down their missing memories in 3 eerie levels of the afterlife.*

***Guiding Light*** is a blind-accessible top-down, narrative-driven adventure game originally produced for [Themed Horror Game Jam #15 - Halloween Edition](https://itch.io/jam/themed-horror-game-jam-15).

Patches are in development for a future submission to [The Rookies](https://www.therookies.co/).
